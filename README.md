## Background

This Python Training site was created to document and share a family project undertaken by a father and son to explore a different approach to learning a new programming language. The language of choice is Python which was selected for a number of reasons including, popularity in the software development community, object oriented architecture, interpreted scripting language, online documentation, and ease of access to install and execute. The challenge is the approach to learning this new programming language Python. For this team we have chosen a real world problem of cryptography as is documented on the [Cryptopals.com](https://cryptopals.com.com) website.

The approach used here is informal and uses the following background and guidelines:

* The father is a career software engineer with a background in software development using a number languages. The father does not have a background developing in Python and is, hence, learning Python from scratch.
* The son 

## Objectives 

* Be accurate, non-judgmental, and understandable. Our goal is to help you find a license that meets *your* goals.
* The homepage should have just enough to help most folks make a decision about what license to use for a project they contribute to.
* For the rest, the site will contain additional information about licenses common to specific communities and situations.
* Collaborate with and reinforce other licensing best practices and standards projects.
* Not comprehensive. Seems like an odd goal, but there are a bajillion licenses out there. We're going to have to filter that down to a small list of those that matter.
