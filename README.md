## Background

This Python Training site was created to document and share a family project undertaken by a father and son team to explore a different approach to learning a new programming language. The language of choice is Python which was selected for a number of reasons including, popularity in the software development community, object oriented architecture, interpreted scripting language, online documentation, and ease of access to install and execute. 

The next challenge is an approach to learning this new programming language Python. The body of Python documentation on the internet combined with published texts is deep and wide. A traditional academic programming language course might follow a textbook of some type designed to give an overall view of the Python language using primarily abstract exercises. A lab execution environment is a requirement, but well within reach of any home computing environment today. Due to the level of interest in learning something about cryptography the team has chosen to use real world problem of cryptography as is documented on the [Cryptopals.com](https://cryptopals.com.com) website. The Cryptopals guys recommend getting your hands dirty with some code so the team is goning to do that with a new unknown language Python. In this way we look at how a particular programming language can be used to solve problems.

The approach used here is informal and uses the following background and guidelines:

* The senior member of the team is a career software engineer with a background in software development using a number languages. The senior does not have a background developing in Python and is, hence, learning Python from scratch.
* The senior member of the team has a background in mathematics and statistics.
* The senior member of the team has a background in hardware architectures and machine language programming.
* The junior member of the team is a rising systems network administrator with a background in firewalls and desktop administration.
* The junior member of the team has programmed in multiple scripting languages, but is new to a more full featured language like Python.
* The problem space defined by the Cryptopals challenges determines the boundary of exploration into the Python language for this project. Only those Python features needed to solve the challenges are explored. 
* This is a self learning environment where existing knowledge is used to learn new concepts using the modern aids available from available websites. Common problems are researched for the specific language construct and adapted to original code in this repo.  

## Repository Structure 

* The structure of this repo is based on the problem sets with python scripts named after the specific challenges.
* After working through the challenges a file of reusable functions was developed to illustrate a simple example of how to write and use functions in python. 
* Examples of how to document source code are embedded in the code files. The minimal standard is to at least provide the original author of the code memory of why a piece of code was written the way it was. This is particularly helpful when using language specific idioms. This particular problem domain lends itself to idioms that are most concise and useful, but cryptic as the data strings they analyze so comments do help even if you wrote the code.

## Repository Use 

* Currently the repository is read-only to the public.
