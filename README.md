## Background

This Python Training site was created to document and share a family project undertaken by a father and son team to explore a different approach to learning a new programming language. The language of choice is Python which was selected for a number of reasons including, popularity in the software development community, object oriented architecture, interpreted scripting language, online documentation, and ease of access to install and execute. 

The next challenge is an approach to learning this new programming language Python. The well of Python documentation on the internet combined with published texts is deep and wide. A traditional academic programming language course might follow a textbook of some type designed to give an overall view of the Python language using primarily abstract exercises. A lab execution environment is a requirement, but well within reach of any home computing environment today. Due to the level of interest in learning something about cryptography the team has chosen to use real world problem of cryptography as is documented on the [Cryptopals.com](https://cryptopals.com.com) website. The Cryptopals guys recommend getting your hands dirty with some code so the team is goning to do that with a new unknown language Python. In this way we look at how a particular programming language can be used to solve problems.

The approach used here is informal and uses the following background and guidelines:

* The senior member of the team is a career software engineer with a background in software development using a number languages. The senior does not have a background developing in Python and is, hence, learning Python from scratch.
* The senior member of the team has a background in mathematics and statistics.
* The senior member of the team has a background in hardware architectures and machine language programming.
* The junior member of the team is a rising systems network administrator with a background in firewalls and desktop administration.
* The junior member of the team has programmed in multiple scripting languages, but is new to a more full featured language like Python.
* The problem space defined by the Cryptopals challenges determines the extend of exploration into the Python language for this project. Only those Python features needed to solve the challenges are explored. 
* The problem domain is limited to the Cryptopals challenges for this project.

## Repository Structure 

* Be accurate, non-judgmental, and understandable. Our goal is to help you find a license that meets *your* goals.
* The homepage should have just enough to help most folks make a decision about what license to use for a project they contribute to.
* For the rest, the site will contain additional information about licenses common to specific communities and situations.
* Collaborate with and reinforce other licensing best practices and standards projects.
* Not comprehensive. Seems like an odd goal, but there are a bajillion licenses out there. We're going to have to filter that down to a small list of those that matter.
